# checkvolumesize

> Autoscale Digital Ocean block storage volumes

Create a Digital Ocean block storage volume and write as much data to it as you want. Run this script on cron to monitor the volume and automatically scale it up in size as required with zero downtime.

Don't worry about manually resizing or running out of space and save money by only paying for what you use.

## Installation

Clone this repo and add `checkvolumesize` to your path. Then add a cron job as root.

```
*/10 * * * * checkvolumesize --log [options] 2>&1 >> /var/log/checkvolumesize.log"
```

You may also need to add:

```
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
```

to your root crontab for the script to be able to find the `resize2fs` binary.

You can view the log in `/var/log/checkvolumesize.log`
